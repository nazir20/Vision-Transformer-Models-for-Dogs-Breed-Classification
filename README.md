<h2>Dog Breed Classification</h2>
<p>This project focuses on building a robust and accurate classification system for identifying different breeds of dogs using cutting-edge vision transformer models. The models used include ViT, Swin, BEiT, DeiT, and LeViT.</p>

<h3>Models Used</h3>
This project leverages several transformer-based models known for their capabilities in image recognition tasks:

- <b>ViT (Vision Transformer):</b> A pioneering model that applies transformers directly to image patches.
- <b>Swin Transformer:</b> A hierarchical vision transformer with a shifted window mechanism for capturing contextual information.
- <b>BEiT (Bidirectional Encoder representation from Image Transformers):</b> Utilizes a transformer-based self-supervised framework for image tasks.
- <b>DeiT (Data-efficient Image Transformer):</b> A robust and data-efficient variant of ViT.
- <b>LeViT</b>: Optimized for low latency and efficiency, well-suited for smaller devices.

<h4>Dataset</h4>
<p>The dataset used for this project was collected through web scraping to compile a comprehensive set of dog breed images. </p>
